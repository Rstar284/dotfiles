# Tokyo Night Obsessed
## What is this
These are my dotfiles. Not all of them, just the ones that have to do with my Linux desktop. But then, probably not all of them.

If this confuses you, then that's because it is confusing. My dotfiles are a mess. I might organize them better at some point, but not now.

If you want to learn something, your best bet is to stay far, far away from my dotfile repositories.

In here, you'll find an absolutely unnecessarily complex swaywm setup, and a bunch of other stuff.

If you're still reading this, then you are either very stubborn, or very interested in looking at a piece of my setup. In that case... good luck.
